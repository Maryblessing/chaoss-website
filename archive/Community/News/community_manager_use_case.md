Introduction
============

Community managers take a variety of perspectives, depending on where
their communities are in the lifecycle of growth, maturity, and decline.
This is an evolving report of what we are learning from community
managers, some of whom we are working with on live experiments with a
CHAOSS project prototyping software tool called Augur
(http://www.github.com/CHAOSS/augur). At this point, we are paying
particular focus to how community managers consume metrics and how the
presentation of open source software health and sustainability metrics
could make them more and in some cases less useful for doing their jobs.

Right now, based on Augur prototypes and follow up discussions so far,
we have the following observations that will inform our work both
the \"Growth Maturity and Decline\" working group and in Augur
Development. Here are a few things we have learned from prototyping
Augur with community managers. These features in Augur are particularly
valued:

1.  Allowing comparisons with projects within a defined universe of 
    of projects is essential

2.  Allow community managers to add and remove repositories that they
    monitor from their repertories periodically

3.  Downloadable graphics

4.  Downloadable data (.csv or .json)

5.  Availability of a \"Metrics API\", limiting the amount of software
    infrastructure the community manager needs to maintain for 
    themselves. This is more
    valued by program managers overseeing larger portfolios right now,
    but we think it has potential to grow as awareness of the relatively
    light weight of this approach becomes more apparent. By apparent, we
    really mean \"easy to use and understand\"; right now it is easy for
    a programmer, but less so for a community manager without this
    background or current interest.

Date Summarized Comparison Metrics
==================================

With these advantages in mind, making the most of this opportunity to
help community managers with useful metrics is going to include the
availability of *date summarized comparison metrics*. These types of
metrics have two \"filters\" or \"parameters\" fed into them that are
more abstractly defined in the Growth, Maturity, and Decline metrics on
the CHAOSS project.

1.  Given a pool of repositories of interest for a community manager,
    rank them in ascending or descending order by a metric

2.  Over a specified time period or

3.  Over a specified periodicity (e.g., month) for a length of time
    (e.g., year).

For example, one open source program officer we talked with is interested
in the following set of *date summarized comparison metrics*. Given a
pool of repositories of interest to the program officer (dozens to
hundreds of repositories):

1.  What ten repositories have the most commits this year (straight
    commits, and lines of code)?

2.  How many new projects were launched this year?

3.  What are the top ten new repositories in terms of commits this year
    (straight commits, and lines of code)?

4.  How many commits and lines of code were contributed by outside
    contributors this calendar year? Organizationally sponsored
    contributors?

5.  What organizations are the top five external contributors of
    commits, comments, and merges?

6.  What are the total number of repository watchers we have across all
    of our projects?

7.  Which repositories have the most stars? Of the ones new this year?
    Of all the projects? Which projects have the most new stars this
    year?

Open Ended Community Manager Questions to Support with Metrics
==============================================================

There are other, more open ended questions that may be useful to open
source community managers:

1.  Is a repository active?

    1.  Visual differentiation that examines issue and commit data

    2.  Activity in the past 30 days

    3.  Across all repositories, present the 50th percentile as a
        baseline and show repositories above and below that line

2.  Should we archive this repository?

    1.  Enable an input from the manager after reviewing statistics

    2.  Activity level, inactivity level and dependencies

    3.  Mean/Median/Mode histogram for commits/repo

3.  Should we feature this repository in our top 10? (Probably a
    subjective decision based on some kind of *composite scoring system*
    that is likely specific to the needs of every community manager or
    program office.)

4.  Who are our top authors? (Some kind of aggregated contribution
    ranking by time period \[year, month, week, day?\]. *nominally, I
    have a concern about these kinds of metrics being \"gameable\", but
    if they are not visible to contributors themselves, there is less
    \"gaming\" opportunity.*)

5.  What are our top repositories? (Probably a subjective decision based
    on some kind of *composite scoring system* that is likely specific
    to the needs of every community manager or program office.)

6.  Most active repositories by time period \[year, month, week?\].
    Activity to be revealed through a mix of retention and maintainer
    activity primarily focusing on the latter. Number of issues and
    commits. Also the frequency of pull requests and the number of
    closed issues.

7.  Least active repositories by time period \[Week? Month? Year?\].
    *Bottom of scores calculated, as above.*

8.  Who is our most active contributor (Some kind of aggregated
    contribution ranking by time period \[year, month, week, day?\].
    *nominally, I have a concern about these kinds of metrics being
    \"gameable\", but if they are not visible to contributors
    themselves, there is less \"gaming\" opportunity.*)

9.  What new contributors submitted their first new patches/issues this
    week? (*Visualization Note:* New contributors can be colored in
    visualizations and then additionally a graph can be made for number
    of new contributors)

10. Which contributors became inactive? (Will need a mechanism for
    setting \"inactive\" thresholds.)

11. Baseline level for the \"average\" repository in an organization and
    for each, individual organization repository.

12. What projects outside of a community manager's general view (GitHub
    organization or other boundary) do my repositories depend on or do
    my contributors also significantly contribute to?

13. Build a summary report in 140 characters or less. For example,
    \"Your total commits in this time period \[month, week?\] across the
    organization increased 12% over the last period. Your most active
    repositories remained the same. You have 8 new contributors, which
    is 1 below your mean for the past year. For more information, click
    here.\"

14. Once a metrics baseline is established, what can be done to move
    them? [^1]

15. Are there optimal measures for some metrics?

    1.  Pull request size?

    2.  Ratio of maintainers to contributors?

    3.  New contributor to consistent contributor ratio?

    4.  New contributor to maintainer ratio?

Augur Specific Design Change Recommendations
============================================

Next is a list of Augur specific design changes suggested thus far,
based on conversations with community managers.

1.  Showing all of the projects in a GitHub organization in a dashboard
    by default is generally useful.

2.  Make the lines more clear in the charts, especially when there are
    multiple lines in comparison

3.  How to zoom in and out is not intuitive. In the case of Google
    Finance, for example, a default, subset period was displayed when
    they used the \"below the line mirrored line\" interface this is
    modeled after. That old model makes it fairly clear that the ability
    to adjust the range of dates is what that box below the line in
    google finance *is for*. Alternately, Google's more updated way of
    representing time, providing users choices, and showing comparisons
    may be even more useful and engaging. In general, its important that
    the time zooming is more clear.

    In one view, Google lets you see a 1 year window of a stock's
    performance:
    ![In one view, Google lets you see a 1 year window of a stock's
    performance.](./images/post5-1.jpg){width="100%"}

    In another view, you can choose a 3 month period. Comparing the
    two time periods also draws out the trend with red or green colors,
    depending on whether or not the index, in this case a stock's price,
    has increased or decreased overall during the selected time
    period:
    ![In another view, you can choose a 3 month period. Comparing the
    two time periods also draws out the trend with red or green colors,
    depending on whether or not the index, in this case a stock's price,
    has increased or decreased overall during the selected time
    period.](./images/post5-2.jpg){width="100%"}

    Comparisons are similarly interesting in Google's finance
    interface. You can simply add a number of stocks in much the same
    way our users want to add a number of different
    repositories:
    ![Comparisons are similarly interesting in Google's finance

    repositories.](./images/post5-3.jpg){width="100%"}

4.  For the projects a community manager chooses to follow, go ahead and
    give them comparison checkboxes at the top of the page. I think from
    a design point of view, we should limit comparisons as discussed, to
    7 or 8, simply due to the limits in human visual perception.

5.  The ability to adjust the viewing windows to a month summary level
    is desired.

6.  Right now, Augur does not make it clear that metrics are, by default,
    aggregated by week.

7.  New contributor response time. When a new contributor joins a
    project, what is the response time for their contribution?

8.  A graph \*\*comparing\*\* commits and commit comments on x and y
    axes \*\*between projects\*\* is desired. Same with Issue and Issue
    comments.

9.  In general, the last two years of data gets the most use. We should
    focus our default display on this range.

Data Source Trust Issues
========================

1.  Greater transparency of metrics data origins will be helpful for
    understanding discrepancies between current understanding and what
    metrics show.

    1.  We should include some detailed notes from Brian Warner about
        how Facade is counting lines of code, and possibly some
        instrumentation to enable those counts to be altered by user
        provided parameters.

    2.  Outside contributor organization Data. One community manager
        reported that their lines of code by organization data seems to
        look wrong. I did explain that these are mapped from a list of
        companies and emails we put together, and getting this right is
        something community managers will need some kind of mapping tool
        to do. GitDM is a tool that people sometimes use to create these
        maps, and Augur does follow a derivative of that work. It is
        probably the case that maintaining these affiliation lists is
        something that needs to be made easier for community managers,
        especially in cases where the number of organizations
        contributing to a project is diverse (there is a substantial
        range among community managers we spoke with. Some are managing
        complex ecosystems involving mostly outside contributors. Most
        are in the middle. And some of contributor lists highly skewed
        toward their own organization.)

2.  GHTorrent data, while excellent for prototyping, faces some
    limitations under the scrutiny of community managers. For example,
    when using the cloned repositories, and then going back to
    \*issues\*, the issues data in GHTorrent does not \"look right\". I
    think the graph API might offers some possibilities for us to store
    issue statistics we pull directly from GitHub and update
    periodically as an alternative to GHTorrent.

3.  When issues are moved from an older system, like Gerrit, into GitHub
    issues, in general, the statistics for the converted issues are
    dodgy, even through the GitHub API. We are likely to encounter this,
    and at some point may want to include Gerrit data in a common data
    structure with issues from GitHub and other sources.

New Metrics Suggested
=====================

1.  Add metric \"number of clones\"

2.  \"Unique visitors\" to a repository is a data point available from
    the GitHub API which is interesting.

3.  Include a metric that is a comparison of the ratio of new committers
    and total committers in a time period. Or, perhaps simply those two
    metrics in alignment. Seeing the number of new committers in a set
    of repositories can be a useful indication of momentum in one
    direction or another; though I hasten to add that this is not
    canonically the case.

4.  Some kind of representation of the ratio between commits and lines
    of code per commit

5.  Test coverage within a repository is something to consider measuring
    for safety critical systems software.

6.  Identifying the relationship between the DCO (Developer Certificate 
    of Origin) and the CLA (Contributor License Agreement).

7.  There is a tension between risk and value that, as our metrics
    develop in those areas, we are well advised to keep in mind.

8.  The work that Matt Snell and Matt Germonprez at the University of
    Nebraska-Omaha are starting related to risk metrics is of great
    interest. Getting these metrics into Augur is something we should
    plan for as soon as reasonably possible.

Design Possibilities
====================

Augur
-----

For Augur, I think the interface changes that enable comparisons and
adjust the level of self apparent ways to compress or expand the time,
as per the Google examples, are at the top of the list of things that
will make Augur more useful for community managers.
Feedback on these notes will be helpful. I think the new committers to
committers ratio is important, as well as enabling comparisons across
projects in the bubble graphs as well. Transparency of data sources and
limitations of data sources for both the API and the front end, which
are above average but not complete, are important.

Growth Maturity and Decline Working Group
-----------------------------------------

Many of the metrics of interest to community managers fall under the
\"Growth Maturity and Decline\" working group. From a design perspective
it appears that, possibly, the way that metrics are expressed and
consumed by these stakeholders in their individual derivatives of the
*community manager use case* is quite far removed from the detailed
definition work occurring around specific metrics. Discussion around an
example implementation like Augur is helping draw out some of this more
\"zoomed out\" feedback. The design of system interfaces frequently
includes the need to navigate between granular details and the overall
user experience [@zemel_what_2007; @barab_our_2007]. This is less of a
focus in the development of software engineering metrics, though recent
research is beginning to illustrate the criticality of visual design for
interpreting analytic information [@gonzalez-torres_knowledge_2016].
