Sorting Hat - Extend data model and user interface to capture better information about contributors


#### Project Description

Grimoirelab is an open-source toolset for software development analytics. Grimoirelab provides a set of tools to collect, analyze and visualize software development metrics from a variety of sources like Git, Jira, Confluence, Slack, etc. In order to manage the identities of people across these different sources, Grimoirelab developed Sorting Hat. Sorting Hat manages the identities of people and related metadata.

As part of the metadata collected around identities, Sorting Hat stores organizational information such as the name and domains related to the organization. This project aims to add to this information by extending the existing Organization model to capture the internal structure of organizations such as departments, sub-organizations, and teams. This will help in annotating the identity information more meaningfully.

Large Social Network Analysis and Anomaly Detection with Augur.


#### Project Description

Augur is a software that collect data for a list of given repositories and provide a variety of CHAOSS metrics to provides open source health and sustainability metrics.Then users can empirically investigate and uncover useful insights for software engineering, such as understanding the collaborative pattern.

In the current stage, Augur is unable to mining the repositories to generate the co-editing information in the open source software development. This project idea is about to develop this kind of functions to enhance the Augur project. It will end up with a new data worker and analysis tool for fine-grained co-editing network which opens up a massive new source of high-resolution data on human collaboration patterns.

Then I would like to establish the Augur server to mining and monitor the open source ecosystem (with 10000+ repositories or more). The collaboration networks and social trace data of all contributors in the open source ecosystem will be evaluated in terms of social network analysis. It will play a vital role in achieving Augur's goal towards analysis of open source organizations health as well as the goal of the CHAOSS project towards diversity and inclusion.

Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection in Open Source Communities


#### Project Description

Open-source software development is a collaborative effort that requires decentralized decision making from different developers and maintainers. In order to measure the progress of the project, It is important to quantify the code changes across time. CHAOSS provides analytics and metrics to help open source communities measure the impact of the developer’s work on the project and the impact of the project on the community. Augur is a prototyped implementation of the CHAOSS Project on open source software metrics which systematically integrates data from several open-source repositories, issue trackers, mailing lists, etc. Anamoly detection is a common data science strategy of finding extreme data points (outliers), whose features differ vastly from other normal data points. From an open-source software development perspective, it detects unusual surges and drops in development activities like code-commits, pull-requests, etc. This project aims to identify the different types of anomalies that are available from trace data and deliver a personalized notification to the user using several machine learning techniques.
