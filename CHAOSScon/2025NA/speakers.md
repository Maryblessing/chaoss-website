### GrimoireLab in Action: Case Studies in Open Source Health Analytics by Terence (Tex) McCutcheon, Intersect MBO, and Georg Link, Bitergia

Discover the impact of open source health analytics. This talk showcases how organizations are moving beyond analytics with the CHAOSS GrimoireLab tool. Through examples from Bitergia’s work with customers, we'll describe the context, tool integrations, and most insightful metrics that lead to new understandings. We'll go into detail on Intersect MBO's work with GrimoireLab for the Cardano Blockchain and its open source projects. You will learn how this young organization, started in 2024, came to understand the contributor landscape, shaped community policies, and developed the Paid Open Source Model (POSM). Furthermore, learn how generative AI supports transparency by automating report generation from GrimoireLab data. Walk away inspired to leverage GrimoireLab’s metrics for insights and strategic action in your own open source initiatives.

### The State of OSS Funding data: Insights from ecosyste.ms by Andrew Nesbitt, Ecosyste.ms

This talk shares insights from ecosyste.ms on how open source projects communicate their funding needs across ecosystems. We’ll explore patterns in funding metadata, gaps in platform visibility, and what the data suggests about the current state of OSS sustainability.

I'm a software engineer based in the UK, specializing in package management, and mining open-source data, ruby and rails. My current focus is Ecosyste.ms, a project that leverages my experience in package management and open data analysis to map dependencies across OSS ecosystems, highlighting the most critical projects in need of support.

### The Hidden Parallel: Why New Contributors and New Maintainers Need the Same Emotional Scaffolding

Open source sustainability discussions often focus on different challenges for contributors versus maintainers, but a critical parallel has been overlooked: both new contributors and maintainers new to opening their projects need remarkably similar emotional scaffolding to get started.

Drawing from her direct experience building contributor infrastructure at Distribute Aid and insights from successful projects like Astro's docs, Laura Langdon will explore this hidden parallel and present a practical model for real-time collaborative sessions that address both groups' needs simultaneously.

New contributors often feel overwhelmed by unfamiliar tools, unclear expectations, and unwritten cultural norms. Similarly, maintainers new to accepting contributions frequently feel lost about how to create welcoming contributor experiences, structure code reviews, or establish community guidelines. **Both groups benefit from the same solution: direct human connection through real-time collaborative sessions** where they can ask questions, get immediate feedback, and observe experienced community members in action.

This talk directly addresses a gap in current community health assessment: while we measure contributor activity after people start participating, we rarely examine the crucial early moments when potential contributors and maintainers decide whether they belong and can succeed.

### The Swiss Cheese Model for Proactive Open Source Risk Management by Georg Link, Bitergia

Overlooking risks within the software supply chain can expose companies and governments to significant future financial liabilities. To explore the potential risks, we'll leverage the Swiss Cheese Model, where various sustainability and maintainability practices represent slices of cheese, each containing potential ""holes"" or attack vectors. A critical danger emerges when these “holes” align across the OSS supply chain, allowing attacks to pass through undetected.

This talk focuses on using community metrics for early detection and meticulous scanning of the open source software supply chain and their protective “slices of cheese”. We will explore how companies can detect “holes” (risks) at scale in terms of active and healthy project maintenance. Because considering all individual risk factors at once is overwhelming, we propose to calculate a total risk score to help identify the projects that have particularly “large holes in their slices of cheese” (are more risky).

Join us to learn about proactively identifying and addressing weaknesses in your open source supply chain, strengthening the resilience, maintainability, and long-term sustainability of your projects. We will show examples of scalable solutions built on top of the CHAOSS GrimoireLab tool.
