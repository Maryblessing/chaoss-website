### GrimoireLab in Action: Case Studies in Open Source Health Analytics by Terence (Tex) McCutcheon, Intersect MBO, and Georg Link, Bitergia

Discover the impact of open source health analytics. This talk showcases how organizations are moving beyond analytics with the CHAOSS GrimoireLab tool. Through examples from Bitergia’s work with customers, we'll describe the context, tool integrations, and most insightful metrics that lead to new understandings. We'll go into detail on Intersect MBO's work with GrimoireLab for the Cardano Blockchain and its open source projects. You will learn how this young organization, started in 2024, came to understand the contributor landscape, shaped community policies, and developed the Paid Open Source Model (POSM). Furthermore, learn how generative AI supports transparency by automating report generation from GrimoireLab data. Walk away inspired to leverage GrimoireLab’s metrics for insights and strategic action in your own open source initiatives.

### The State of OSS Funding data: Insights from ecosyste.ms by Andrew Nesbitt, Ecosyste.ms

This talk shares insights from ecosyste.ms on how open source projects communicate their funding needs across ecosystems. We’ll explore patterns in funding metadata, gaps in platform visibility, and what the data suggests about the current state of OSS sustainability.

**Andrew Nesbitt**, Software Engineer at Ecosyste.ms

I'm a software engineer based in the UK, specializing in package management, and mining open-source data, ruby and rails. My current focus is Ecosyste.ms, a project that leverages my experience in package management and open data analysis to map dependencies across OSS ecosystems, highlighting the most critical projects in need of support.

### A Guided Tour of an Open Source Community Using 8Knot	by Cali Dolfi, Red Hat

In this demo, you’ll learn how to navigate and analyze open source communities using 8Knot. We’ll explore how its powerful metrics and visualizations can help you uncover community trends, identify potential issues, and make more informed project decisions.

**Cali Dolfi**, Senior Data Scientist	at Red Hat

Cali Dolfi is a Senior Data Scientist in the Open Source Program Office at Red Hat. Her work focuses on changing the way we look at open source communities through the lens of data science and machine learning. Outside of data science, her passion lies in making careers in technology more accessible for underrepresented groups by mentoring college students and developing accessible academic resources. Outside of her open source work, you can find her at the nearest ski lift.

### Git the Data: Augur’s 15-Minute Collection Kickstart

Over the last 6 months, there have been countless improvements to the Augur project that now allows users to use Docker or Podman to get started with the project in minutes. This talk will be a live demo to go from git clone to a new database built with collection up and running.

His open source research is framed around a broader agenda of social computing research, which he pursues as an associate professor of computer science at the University of Missouri.  

### The Swiss Cheese Model for Proactive Open Source Risk Management by Georg Link, Bitergia

Overlooking risks within the software supply chain can expose companies and governments to significant future financial liabilities. To explore the potential risks, we'll leverage the Swiss Cheese Model, where various sustainability and maintainability practices represent slices of cheese, each containing potential ""holes"" or attack vectors. A critical danger emerges when these “holes” align across the OSS supply chain, allowing attacks to pass through undetected.

This talk focuses on using community metrics for early detection and meticulous scanning of the open source software supply chain and their protective “slices of cheese”. We will explore how companies can detect “holes” (risks) at scale in terms of active and healthy project maintenance. Because considering all individual risk factors at once is overwhelming, we propose to calculate a total risk score to help identify the projects that have particularly “large holes in their slices of cheese” (are more risky).

Join us to learn about proactively identifying and addressing weaknesses in your open source supply chain, strengthening the resilience, maintainability, and long-term sustainability of your projects. We will show examples of scalable solutions built on top of the CHAOSS GrimoireLab tool.
