## About CHAOSS Data Science Hackathon
The [CHAOSS Data Science Working Group](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-data-science) is a community of folks collaborating on data science projects and how to guides within the CHAOSS project. We welcome data scientists, data analysts, researchers, and others with an interest in data. The goal of this hackathon is to drive interest in CHAOSS data science projects while making progress on one of more of our projects. The projects will be selected based on which members of the community plan to attend and are available to help lead people through the work. We plan to have a variety of activities so that everyone will have something to contribute whether they are new to data science or an experienced professional. This will likely include everything from data gathering and analysis to writing up results of our research.

### What types of projects will we work on in the hackathon?
You'll be working on data science projects related to open source—things like cleaning, collecting, analyzing, and visualizing open source project data. No prior experience in healthcare or open source is required! We’ll provide project ideas and support to help you get started, whether you're a beginner or a seasoned data expert.
