**Talk abstract:**


It's less than a year in I started contributing to open source, I know I have a lot to learn but I am already here. I now know I don't need to write code to contribute to open source and I want to share my open source story, and inspire other non code professionals.
This talk shares how I went from newcomer to contributor, the strategies and people who made it possible, and why every newcomer belong here too. 

It also highlights how open source isn’t about years of experience, but also about open doors, and how inclusion and accessibility played a huge role.
